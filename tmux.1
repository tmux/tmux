.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a terminal multiplexer:
it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and
controlled from a single screen.
.Nm
may be detached from a screen
and continue running in the background,
then later reattached.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is started it creates a new
.Em session
with a single
.Em window
and displays it on screen.
A status line at the bottom of the screen
shows information on the current session
and is used to enter interactive commands.
.Pp
A session is a single collection of
.Em pseudo terminals
under the management of
.Nm .
Each session has one or more
windows linked to it.
A window occupies the entire screen
and may be split into rectangular panes,
each of which is a separate pseudo terminal
(the
.Xr pty 7
manual page documents the technical details of pseudo terminals).
Any number of
.Nm
instances may connect to the same session,
and any number of windows may be present in the same session.
Once all sessions are killed,
.Nm
exits.
.Pp
Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection
(such as
.Xr ssh 1
connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the
.Ql C-b d
key strokes).
.Nm
may be reattached using:
.Pp
.Dl $ tmux attach
.Pp
In
.Nm ,
a session is displayed on screen by a
.Em client
and all sessions are managed by a single
.Em server .
The server and each client are separate processes which communicate through a
socket in
.Pa /tmp .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXXXXXXXX"
.It Fl 2
Force
.Nm
to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.
.It Fl C
Start in control mode (see the
.Sx CONTROL MODE
section).
Given twice
.Xo ( Fl CC ) Xc
disables echo.
.It Fl c Ar shell-command
Execute
.Ar shell-command
using the default shell.
If necessary, the
.Nm
server will be started to retrieve the
.Ic default-shell
option.
This option is for compatibility with
.Xr sh 1
when
.Nm
is used as a login shell.
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
By default,
.Nm
loads the system configuration file from
.Pa @SYSCONFDIR@/tmux.conf ,
if present, then looks for a user configuration file at
.Pa ~/.tmux.conf .
.Pp
The configuration file is a set of
.Nm
commands which are executed in sequence when the server is first started.
.Nm
loads configuration files once when the server process has started.
The
.Ic source-file
command may be used to load a file later.
.Pp
.Nm
shows any error messages from commands in configuration files in the first
session created, and continues to process the rest of the configuration file.
.It Fl L Ar socket-name
.Nm
stores the server socket in a directory under
.Ev TMUX_TMPDIR ,
.Ev TMPDIR
if it is unset, or
.Pa /tmp
if both are unset.
The default socket is named
.Em default .
This option allows a different socket name to be specified, allowing several
independent
.Nm
servers to be run.
Unlike
.Fl S
a full path is not necessary: the sockets are all created in the same
directory.
.Pp
If the socket is accidentally removed, the
.Dv SIGUSR1
signal may be sent to the
.Nm
server process to recreate it (note that this will fail if any parent
directories are missing).
.It Fl l
Behave as a login shell.
This flag currently has no effect and is for compatibility with other shells
when using tmux as a login shell.
.It Fl S Ar socket-path
Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.
If
.Fl S
is specified, the default socket directory is not used and any
.Fl L
flag is ignored.
.It Fl u
.Nm
attempts to guess if the terminal is likely to support UTF-8 by checking the
first of the
.Ev LC_ALL ,
.Ev LC_CTYPE
and
.Ev LANG
environment variables to be set for the string "UTF-8".
This is not always correct: the
.Fl u
flag explicitly informs
.Nm
that UTF-8 is supported.
.Pp
If the server is started from a client passed
.Fl u
or where UTF-8 is detected, the
.Ic utf8
and
.Ic status-utf8
options are enabled in the global window and session options respectively.
.It Fl v
Request verbose logging.
This option may be specified multiple times for increasing verbosity.
Log messages will be saved into
.Pa tmux-client-PID.log
and
.Pa tmux-server-PID.log
files in the current directory, where
.Em PID
is the PID of the server or client process.
.It Fl V
Report the
.Nm
version.
.It Ar command Op Ar flags
This specifies one of a set of commands used to control
.Nm ,
as described in the following sections.
If no commands are specified, the
.Ic new-session
command is assumed.
.El

.El
.Pp

.Sh COMMANDS
This section contains a list of the commands supported by
.Nm .
Most commands accept the optional
.Fl t
(and sometimes
.Fl s )
argument with one of
.Ar target-client ,
.Ar target-session
.Ar target-window ,
or
.Ar target-pane .
These specify the client, session, window or pane which a command should affect.
.Pp
.Ar target-client
is the name of the
.Xr pty 7
file to which the client is connected, for example either of
.Pa /dev/ttyp1
or
.Pa ttyp1
for the client attached to
.Pa /dev/ttyp1 .
If no client is specified,
.Nm
attempts to work out the client currently in use; if that fails, an error is
reported.
Clients may be listed with the
.Ic list-clients
command.
.Pp
.Ar target-session
is tried as, in order:
.Bl -enum -offset Ds
.It
A session ID prefixed with a $.
.It
An exact name of a session (as listed by the
.Ic list-sessions
command).
.It
The start of a session name, for example
.Ql mysess
would match a session named
.Ql mysession .
.It
An
.Xr fnmatch 3
pattern which is matched against the session name.
.El
.Pp
If the session name is prefixed with an
.Ql = ,
only an exact match is accepted (so
.Ql =mysess
will only match exactly
.Ql mysess ,
not
.Ql mysession ) .
.Pp
If a single session is found, it is used as the target session; multiple matches
produce an error.
If a session is omitted, the current session is used if available; if no
current session is available, the most recently used is chosen.
.Pp
.Ar target-window
specifies a window in the form
.Em session Ns \&: Ns Em window .
.Em session
follows the same rules as for
.Ar target-session ,
and
.Em window
is looked for in order as:
.Bl -enum -offset Ds
.It
A special token, listed below.
.It
A window index, for example
.Ql mysession:1
is window 1 in session
.Ql mysession .
.It
A window ID, such as @1.
.It
An exact window name, such as
.Ql mysession:mywindow .
.It
The start of a window name, such as
.Ql mysession:mywin .
.It
As an
.Xr fnmatch 3
pattern matched against the window name.
.El
.Pp
Like sessions, a
.Ql =
prefix will do an exact match only.
An empty window name specifies the next unused index if appropriate (for
example the
.Ic new-window
and
.Ic link-window
commands)
otherwise the current window in
.Em session
is chosen.
.Pp
The following special tokens are available to indicate particular windows.
Each has a single-character alternative form.
.Bl -column "XXXXXXXXXX" "X"
.It Sy "Token" Ta Sy "" Ta Sy "Meaning"
.It Li "{start}" Ta "^" Ta "The lowest-numbered window"
.It Li "{end}" Ta "$" Ta "The highest-numbered window"
.It Li "{last}" Ta "!" Ta "The last (previously current) window"
.It Li "{next}" Ta "+" Ta "The next window by number"
.It Li "{previous}" Ta "-" Ta "The previous window by number"
.El
.Pp
.Ar target-pane
may be a
pane ID or takes a similar form to
.Ar target-window
but with the optional addition of a period followed by a pane index or pane ID,
for example:
.Ql mysession:mywindow.1 .
If the pane index is omitted, the currently active pane in the specified
window is used.
The following special tokens are available for the pane index:
.Bl -column "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX" "X"
.It Sy "Token" Ta Sy "" Ta Sy "Meaning"
.It Li "{last}" Ta "!" Ta "The last (previously active) pane"
.It Li "{next}" Ta "+" Ta "The next pane by number"
.It Li "{previous}" Ta "-" Ta "The previous pane by number"
.It Li "{top}" Ta "" Ta "The top pane"
.It Li "{bottom}" Ta "" Ta "The bottom pane"
.It Li "{left}" Ta "" Ta "The leftmost pane"
.It Li "{right}" Ta "" Ta "The rightmost pane"
.It Li "{top-left}" Ta "" Ta "The top-left pane"
.It Li "{top-right}" Ta "" Ta "The top-right pane"
.It Li "{bottom-left}" Ta "" Ta "The bottom-left pane"
.It Li "{bottom-right}" Ta "" Ta "The bottom-right pane"
.It Li "{up-of}" Ta "" Ta "The pane above the active pane"
.It Li "{down-of}" Ta "" Ta "The pane below the active pane"
.It Li "{left-of}" Ta "" Ta "The pane to the left of the active pane"
.It Li "{right-of}" Ta "" Ta "The pane to the right of the active pane"
.El
.Pp
The tokens
.Ql +
and
.Ql -
may be followed by an offset, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
select-window -t:+2
.Ed
.Pp
In addition,
.Em target-session ,
.Em target-window
or
.Em target-pane
may consist entirely of the token
.Ql {mouse}
(alternative form
.Ql = )
to specify the most recent mouse event
(see the
.Sx MOUSE SUPPORT
section)
or
.Ql {marked}
(alternative form
.Ql ~ )
to specify the marked pane (see
.Ic select-pane
.Fl m ) .
.Pp
Sessions, window and panes are each numbered with a unique ID; session IDs are
prefixed with a
.Ql $ ,
windows with a
.Ql @ ,
and panes with a
.Ql % .
These are unique and are unchanged for the life of the session, window or pane
in the
.Nm
server.
The pane ID is passed to the child process of the pane in the
.Ev TMUX_PANE
environment variable.
IDs may be displayed using the
.Ql session_id ,
.Ql window_id ,
or
.Ql pane_id
formats (see the
.Sx FORMATS
section) and the
.Ic display-message ,
.Ic list-sessions ,
.Ic list-windows
or
.Ic list-panes
commands.
.Pp
.Ar shell-command
arguments are
.Xr sh 1
commands.
This may be a single argument passed to the shell, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
new-window 'vi /etc/passwd'
.Ed
.Pp
Will run:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/bin/sh -c 'vi /etc/passwd'
.Ed
.Pp
Additionally, the
.Ic new-window ,
.Ic new-session ,
.Ic split-window ,
.Ic respawn-window
and
.Ic respawn-pane
commands allow
.Ar shell-command
to be given as multiple arguments and executed directly (without
.Ql sh -c ) .
This can avoid issues with shell quoting.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ tmux new-window vi /etc/passwd
.Ed
.Pp
Will run
.Xr vi 1
directly without invoking the shell.
.Pp
.Ar command
.Op Ar arguments
refers to a
.Nm
command, passed with the command and arguments separately, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81
.Ed
.Pp
Or if using
.Xr sh 1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ tmux bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81
.Ed
.Pp
Multiple commands may be specified together as part of a
.Em command sequence .
Each command should be separated by spaces and a semicolon;
commands are executed sequentially from left to right and
lines ending with a backslash continue on to the next line,
except when escaped by another backslash.
A literal semicolon may be included by escaping it with a backslash (for
example, when specifying a command sequence to
.Ic bind-key ) .
.Pp
Example
.Nm
commands include:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2

rename-session -tfirst newname

set-window-option -t:0 monitor-activity on

new-window ; split-window -d

bind-key R source-file ~/.tmux.conf \e; \e
	display-message "source-file done"
.Ed
.Pp
Or from
.Xr sh 1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ tmux kill-window -t :1

$ tmux new-window \e; split-window -d

$ tmux new-session -d 'vi /etc/passwd' \e; split-window -d \e; attach
.Ed
.Sh CLIENTS AND SESSIONS
The
.Nm
server manages clients, sessions, windows and panes.
Clients are attached to sessions to interact with them, either
when they are created with the
.Ic new-session
command, or later with the
.Ic attach-session
command.
Each session has one or more windows
.Em linked
into it.
Windows may be linked to multiple sessions and are made up of one or
more panes,
each of which contains a pseudo terminal.
Commands for creating, linking and otherwise manipulating windows
are covered
in the
.Sx WINDOWS AND PANES
section.
.Pp
The following commands are available to manage clients and sessions:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic attach-session
.Op Fl dEr
.Op Fl c Ar working-directory
.Op Fl t Ar target-session
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic attach )
If run from outside
.Nm ,
create a new client in the current terminal and attach it to
.Ar target-session .
If used from inside, switch the current client.
If
.Fl d
is specified, any other clients attached to the session are detached.
.Fl r
signifies the client is read-only (only keys bound to the
.Ic detach-client
or
.Ic switch-client
commands have any effect)
.Pp
If no server is started,
.Ic attach-session
will attempt to start it; this will fail unless sessions are created in the
configuration file.
.Pp
The
.Ar target-session
rules for
.Ic attach-session
are slightly adjusted: if
.Nm
needs to select the most recently used session, it will prefer the most
recently used
.Em unattached
session.
.Pp
.Fl c
will set the session working directory (used for new windows) to
.Ar working-directory .
.Pp
If
.Fl E
is used,
.Ic update-environment
option will not be applied.
.It Xo Ic detach-client
.Op Fl P
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl s Ar target-session
.Op Fl t Ar target-client
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic detach )
Detach the current client if bound to a key, the client specified with
.Fl t ,
or all clients currently attached to the session specified by
.Fl s .
The
.Fl a
option kills all but the client given with
.Fl t .
If
.Fl P
is given, send SIGHUP to the parent process of the client, typically causing it
to exit.
.It Ic has-session Op Fl t Ar target-session
.D1 (alias: Ic has )
Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does not exist.
If it does exist, exit with 0.
.It Ic kill-server
Kill the
.Nm
server and clients and destroy all sessions.
.It Xo Ic kill-session
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl t Ar target-session
.Xc
Destroy the given session, closing any windows linked to it and no other
sessions, and detaching all clients attached to it.
If
.Fl a
is given, all sessions but the specified one is killed.
.It Xo Ic list-clients
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl t Ar target-session
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic lsc )
List all clients attached to the server.
For the meaning of the
.Fl F
flag, see the
.Sx FORMATS
section.
If
.Ar target-session
is specified, list only clients connected to that session.
.It Ic list-commands
.D1 (alias: Ic lscm )
List the syntax of all commands supported by
.Nm .
.It Ic list-sessions Op Fl F Ar format
.D1 (alias: Ic ls )
List all sessions managed by the server.
For the meaning of the
.Fl F
flag, see the
.Sx FORMATS
section.
.It Ic lock-client Op Fl t Ar target-client
.D1 (alias: Ic lockc )
Lock
.Ar target-client ,
see the
.Ic lock-server
command.
.It Ic lock-session Op Fl t Ar target-session
.D1 (alias: Ic locks )
Lock all clients attached to
.Ar target-session .
.It Xo Ic new-session
.Op Fl AdDEP
.Op Fl c Ar start-directory
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl n Ar window-name
.Op Fl s Ar session-name
.Op Fl t Ar target-session
.Op Fl x Ar width
.Op Fl y Ar height
.Op Ar shell-command
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic new )
Create a new session with name
.Ar session-name .
.Pp
The new session is attached to the current terminal unless
.Fl d
is given.
.Ar window-name
and
.Ar shell-command
are the name of and shell command to execute in the initial window.
If
.Fl d
is used,
.Fl x
and
.Fl y
specify the size of the initial window (80 by 24 if not given).
.Pp
If run from a terminal, any
.Xr termios 3
special characters are saved and used for new windows in the new session.
.Pp
The
.Fl A
flag makes
.Ic new-session
behave like
.Ic attach-session
if
.Ar session-name
already exists; in this case,
.Fl D
behaves like
.Fl d
to
.Ic attach-session .
.Pp
If
.Fl t
is given, the new session is
.Em grouped
with
.Ar target-session .
This means they share the same set of windows - all windows from
.Ar target-session
are linked to the new session and any subsequent new windows or windows being
closed are applied to both sessions.
The current and previous window and any session options remain independent and
either session may be killed without affecting the other.
Giving
.Fl n
or
.Ar shell-command
are invalid if
.Fl t
is used.
.Pp
The
.Fl P
option prints information about the new session after it has been created.
By default, it uses the format
.Ql #{session_name}:
but a different format may be specified with
.Fl F .
.Pp
If
.Fl E
is used,
.Ic update-environment
option will not be applied.
.Ic update-environment .
.It Xo Ic refresh-client
.Op Fl S
.Op Fl t Ar target-client
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic refresh )
Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single client if one is given
with
.Fl t .
If
.Fl S
is specified, only update the client's status bar.
.It Xo Ic rename-session
.Op Fl t Ar target-session
.Ar new-name
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic rename )
Rename the session to
.Ar new-name .
.It Xo Ic show-messages
.Op Fl IJT
.Op Fl t Ar target-client
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic showmsgs )
Show client messages or server information.
Any messages displayed on the status line are saved in a per-client message
log, up to a maximum of the limit set by the
.Ar message-limit
server option.
With
.Fl t ,
display the log for
.Ar target-client .
.Fl I ,
.Fl J
and
.Fl T
show debugging information about the running server, jobs and terminals.
.It Ic source-file Ar path
.D1 (alias: Ic source )
Execute commands from
.Ar path .
.It Ic start-server
.D1 (alias: Ic start )
Start the
.Nm
server, if not already running, without creating any sessions.
.It Xo Ic suspend-client
.Op Fl t Ar target-client
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic suspendc )
Suspend a client by sending
.Dv SIGTSTP
(tty stop).
.It Xo Ic switch-client
.Op Fl Elnpr
.Op Fl c Ar target-client
.Op Fl t Ar target-session
.Op Fl T Ar key-table
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic switchc )
Switch the current session for client
.Ar target-client
to
.Ar target-session .
If
.Fl l ,
.Fl n
or
.Fl p
is used, the client is moved to the last, next or previous session
respectively.
.Fl r
toggles whether a client is read-only (see the
.Ic attach-session
command).
.Pp
If
.Fl E
is used,
.Ic update-environment
option will not be applied.
.Pp
.Fl T
sets the client's key table; the next key from the client will be interpreted from
.Ar key-table .
This may be used to configure multiple prefix keys, or to bind commands to
sequences of keys.
For example, to make typing
.Ql abc
run the
.Ic list-keys
command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind-key -Ttable2 c list-keys
bind-key -Ttable1 b switch-client -Ttable2
bind-key -Troot   a switch-client -Ttable1
.Ed
.El
.Sh WINDOWS AND PANES
A
.Nm
window may be in one of several modes.
The default permits direct access to the terminal attached to the window.
The other is copy mode, which permits a section of a window or its
history to be copied to a
.Em paste buffer
for later insertion into another window.
This mode is entered with the
.Ic copy-mode
command, bound to
.Ql \&[
by default.
It is also entered when a command that produces output, such as
.Ic list-keys ,
is executed from a key binding.
.Pp
The keys available depend on whether emacs or vi mode is selected
(see the
.Ic mode-keys
option).
The following keys are supported as appropriate for the mode:
.Bl -column "FunctionXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" "viXXXXXXXXXX" "emacs" -offset indent
.It Sy "Function" Ta Sy "vi" Ta Sy "emacs"
.It Li "Append selection" Ta "A" Ta ""
.It Li "Back to indentation" Ta "^" Ta "M-m"
.It Li "Bottom of history" Ta "G" Ta "M-<"
.It Li "Clear selection" Ta "Escape" Ta "C-g"
.It Li "Copy selection" Ta "Enter" Ta "M-w"
.It Li "Copy to named buffer" Ta \&" Ta ""
.It Li "Cursor down" Ta "j" Ta "Down"
.It Li "Cursor left" Ta "h" Ta "Left"
.It Li "Cursor right" Ta "l" Ta "Right"

.Pp
The next and previous word keys use space and the
.Ql - ,
.Ql _
and
.Ql @
characters as word delimiters by default, but this can be adjusted by
setting the
.Em word-separators
session option.
Next word moves to the start of the next word, next word end to the end of the
next word and previous word to the start of the previous word.
The three next and previous space keys work similarly but use a space alone as
the word separator.
.Pp
The jump commands enable quick movement within a line.
For instance, typing
.Ql f
followed by
.Ql /
will move the cursor to the next
.Ql /
character on the current line.
A
.Ql \&;
will then jump to the next occurrence.
.Pp
Commands in copy mode may be prefaced by an optional repeat count.
With vi key bindings, a prefix is entered using the number keys; with
emacs, the Alt (meta) key and a number begins prefix entry.
For example, to move the cursor forward by ten words, use
.Ql M-1 0 M-f
in emacs mode, and
.Ql 10w
in vi.
.Pp
Mode key bindings are defined in a set of named tables:
.Em vi-edit
and
.Em emacs-edit
for keys used when line editing at the command prompt;
.Em vi-choice
and
.Em emacs-choice
for keys used when choosing from lists (such as produced by the
.Ic choose-window
command); and
.Em vi-copy
and
.Em emacs-copy
used in copy mode.
The tables may be viewed with the
.Ic list-keys
command and keys modified or removed with
.Ic bind-key
and
.Ic unbind-key .
If
.Ic append-selection ,
.Ic copy-selection ,
or
.Ic start-named-buffer
are given the
.Fl x
flag,
.Nm
will not exit copy mode after copying.
.Ic copy-pipe
copies the selection and pipes it to a command.
For example the following will bind
.Ql C-w
not to exit after copying and
.Ql C-q
to copy the selection into
.Pa /tmp
as well as the paste buffer:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind-key -temacs-copy C-w copy-selection -x
bind-key -temacs-copy C-q copy-pipe "cat >/tmp/out"
.Ed
.Pp
The paste buffer key pastes the first line from the top paste buffer on the
stack.
.Pp
The synopsis for the
.Ic copy-mode
command is:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic copy-mode
.Op Fl Meu
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Xc
Enter copy mode.
The
.Fl u
option scrolls one page up.
.Fl M
begins a mouse drag (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see
.Sx MOUSE SUPPORT ) .
.Fl e
specifies that scrolling to the bottom of the history (to the visible screen)
should exit copy mode.
While in copy mode, pressing a key other than those used for scrolling will
disable this behaviour.
This is intended to allow fast scrolling through a pane's history, for
example with:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind PageUp copy-mode -eu
.Ed
.El
.Pp
Each window displayed by
.Nm
may be split into one or more
.Em panes ;
each pane takes up a certain area of the display and is a separate terminal.
A window may be split into panes using the
.Ic split-window
command.
Windows may be split horizontally (with the
.Fl h
flag) or vertically.
Panes may be resized with the
.Ic resize-pane
command (bound to
.Ql C-up ,
.Ql C-down
.Ql C-left
and
.Ql C-right
by default), the current pane may be changed with the
.Ic select-pane
command and the
.Ic rotate-window
and
.Ic swap-pane
commands may be used to swap panes without changing their position.
Panes are numbered beginning from zero in the order they are created.
.Pp
A number of preset
.Em layouts
are available.
These may be selected with the
.Ic select-layout
command or cycled with
.Ic next-layout
(bound to
.Ql Space
by default); once a layout is chosen, panes within it may be moved and resized
as normal.
.Pp
The following layouts are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic even-horizontal
Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.
.It Ic even-vertical
Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.
.It Ic main-horizontal
A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the remaining panes
are spread from left to right in the leftover space at the bottom.
Use the
.Em main-pane-height
window option to specify the height of the top pane.
.It Ic main-vertical
Similar to
.Ic main-horizontal
but the large pane is placed on the left and the others spread from top to
bottom along the right.
See the
.Em main-pane-width
window option.
.It Ic tiled
Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in both rows and
columns.
.El
.Pp
In addition,
.Ic select-layout
may be used to apply a previously used layout - the
.Ic list-windows
command displays the layout of each window in a form suitable for use with
.Ic select-layout .
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ tmux list-windows
0: ksh [159x48]
    layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
$ tmux select-layout bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current window size.
Note that a layout cannot be applied to a window with more panes than that
from which the layout was originally defined.
.Pp
Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic break-pane
.Op Fl dP
.Op Fl F Ar format

.Op Fl t Ar dst-pane
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic breakp )
Break
.Ar src-pane
off from its containing window to make it the only pane in
.Ar dst-window .
If
.Fl d
is given, the new window does not become the current window.
The
.Fl P
option prints information about the new window after it has been created.
By default, it uses the format
.Ql #{session_name}:#{window_index}
but a different format may be specified with
.Fl F .
.It Xo Ic capture-pane
.Op Fl aepPq
.Op Fl b Ar buffer-name
.Op Fl E Ar end-line
.Op Fl S Ar start-line
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic capturep )
Capture the contents of a pane.
If
.Fl p
is given, the output goes to stdout, otherwise to the buffer specified with
.Fl b
or a new buffer if omitted.
If
.Fl a
is given, the alternate screen is used, and the history is not accessible.
If no alternate screen exists, an error will be returned unless
.Fl q
is given.
If
.Fl e
is given, the output includes escape sequences for text and background
attributes.
.Fl C
also escapes non-printable characters as octal \exxx.
.Fl J
joins wrapped lines and preserves trailing spaces at each line's end.
.Fl P
captures only any output that the pane has received that is the beginning of an
as-yet incomplete escape sequence.
.Pp
.Fl S
and
.Fl E
specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is the first line of the
visible pane and negative numbers are lines in the history.
.Ql -
to
.Fl S
is the start of the history and to
.Fl E
the end of the visible pane.
The default is to capture only the visible contents of the pane.
.It Xo
.Ic choose-client
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl t Ar target-window
.Op Ar template
.Xc
Put a window into client choice mode, allowing a client to be selected
interactively from a list.
After a client is chosen,
.Ql %%
is replaced by the client
.Xr pty 7
path in
.Ar template
and the result executed as a command.
If
.Ar template
is not given, "detach-client -t '%%'" is used.
For the meaning of the
.Fl F
flag, see the
.Sx FORMATS
section.
This command works only if at least one client is attached.
.It Xo
.Ic choose-session
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl t Ar target-window
.Op Ar template
.Xc
Put a window into session choice mode, where a session may be selected
interactively from a list.
When one is chosen,
.Ql %%
is replaced by the session name in
.Ar template
and the result executed as a command.
If
.Ar template
is not given, "switch-client -t '%%'" is used.
For the meaning of the
.Fl F
flag, see the
.Sx FORMATS
section.
This command works only if at least one client is attached.
.It Xo
.Ic choose-tree
.Op Fl suw
.Op Fl b Ar session-template

.Op Fl S Ar format
.Op Fl W Ar format
.Op Fl t Ar target-window
.Xc
Put a window into tree choice mode, where either sessions or windows may be
selected interactively from a list.
By default, windows belonging to a session are indented to show their
relationship to a session.
.Pp
Note that the
.Ic choose-window
and
.Ic choose-session
commands are wrappers around
.Ic choose-tree .
.Pp
If
.Fl s
is given, will show sessions.
If
.Fl w
is given, will show windows.
.Pp
By default, the tree is collapsed and sessions must be expanded to windows
with the right arrow key.
The
.Fl u
option will start with all sessions expanded instead.
.Pp
If
.Fl b
is given, will override the default session command.
Note that
.Ql %%
can be used and will be replaced with the session name.
The default option if not specified is "switch-client -t '%%'".
If
.Fl c
is given, will override the default window command.
Like
.Fl b ,
.Ql %%
can be used and will be replaced with the session name and window index.
When a window is chosen from the list, the session command is run before the
window command.
.Pp
If
.Fl S
is given will display the specified format instead of the default session
format.
If
.Fl W
is given will display the specified format instead of the default window
format.
For the meaning of the
.Fl s
and
.Fl w
options, see the
.Sx FORMATS
section.
.Pp
This command works only if at least one client is attached.
.It Xo
.Ic choose-window
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl t Ar target-window
.Op Ar template
.Xc

The flags control matching behavior:
.Fl C
matches only visible window contents,
.Fl N
matches only the window name and
.Fl T
matches only the window title.
The default is
.Fl CNT .
If only one window is matched, it'll be automatically selected,
otherwise a choice list is shown.
For the meaning of the
.Fl F
flag, see the
.Sx FORMATS
section.
This command works only if at least one client is attached.
.It Xo Ic join-pane

.D1 (alias: Ic joinp )
Like
.Ic split-window ,
but instead of splitting
.Ar dst-pane
and creating a new pane, split it and move
.Ar src-pane
into the space.
This can be used to reverse
.Ic break-pane .
The
.Fl b
option causes
.Ar src-pane
to be joined to left of or above
.Ar dst-pane .
.Pp
If
.Fl s
is omitted and a marked pane is present (see
.Ic select-pane
.Fl m ) ,
the marked pane is used rather than the current pane.
.It Xo Ic kill-pane
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic killp )

to the specified
.Ar dst-window .
If
.Ar dst-window
is specified and no such window exists, the
.Ar src-window
is linked there.
With
.Fl a ,
the window is moved to the next index up (following windows
are moved if necessary).
If
.Fl k
is given and
.Ar dst-window
exists, it is killed, otherwise an error is generated.
If
.Fl d
is given, the newly linked window is not selected.
.It Xo Ic list-panes
.Op Fl as
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl t Ar target
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic lsp )
If
.Fl a
is given,
.Ar target
is ignored and all panes on the server are listed.
If
.Fl s

.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic movew )
This is similar to
.Ic link-window ,
except the window at
.Ar src-window
is moved to
.Ar dst-window .
With
.Fl r ,
all windows in the session are renumbered in sequential order, respecting
the
.Ic base-index
option.
.It Xo Ic new-window
.Op Fl adkP

.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl n Ar window-name
.Op Fl t Ar target-window
.Op Ar shell-command
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic neww )
Create a new window.
With
.Fl a ,
the new window is inserted at the next index up from the specified
.Ar target-window ,
moving windows up if necessary,
otherwise
.Ar target-window
is the new window location.
.Pp
If
.Fl d
is given, the session does not make the new window the current window.
.Ar target-window
represents the window to be created; if the target already exists an error is
shown, unless the
.Fl k
flag is used, in which case it is destroyed.
.Ar shell-command
is the command to execute.
If
.Ar shell-command
is not specified, the value of the
.Ic default-command
option is used.
.Fl c
specifies the working directory in which the new window is created.
.Pp
When the shell command completes, the window closes.
See the
.Ic remain-on-exit
option to change this behaviour.
.Pp
The
.Ev TERM
environment variable must be set to
.Dq screen
for all programs running
.Em inside
.Nm .
New windows will automatically have
.Dq TERM=screen
added to their environment, but care must be taken not to reset this in shell
start-up files.
.Pp
The
.Fl P
option prints information about the new window after it has been created.
By default, it uses the format

A pane may only be piped to one command at a time, any existing pipe is
closed before
.Ar shell-command
is executed.
The
.Ar shell-command
string may contain the special character sequences supported by the
.Ic status-left
option.
If no
.Ar shell-command
is given, the current pipe (if any) is closed.
.Pp
The
.Fl o
option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists, allowing a pipe to
be toggled with a single key, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind-key C-p pipe-pane -o 'cat >>~/output.#I-#P'
.Ed
.It Xo Ic previous-layout

With
.Fl Z ,
the active pane is toggled between zoomed (occupying the whole of the window)
and unzoomed (its normal position in the layout).
.Pp
.Fl M
begins mouse resizing (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see
.Sx MOUSE SUPPORT ) .
.It Xo Ic respawn-pane
.Op Fl k
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Op Ar shell-command
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic respawnp )
Reactivate a pane in which the command has exited (see the
.Ic remain-on-exit
window option).
If
.Ar shell-command

.Op Fl nop
.Op Fl t Ar target-window
.Op Ar layout-name
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic selectl )
Choose a specific layout for a window.
If
.Ar layout-name
is not given, the last preset layout used (if any) is reapplied.
.Fl n
and
.Fl p
are equivalent to the
.Ic next-layout
and
.Ic previous-layout
commands.
.Fl o
applies the last set layout if possible (undoes the most recent layout change).
.It Xo Ic select-pane
.Op Fl DdegLlMmRU

.Ar target-window ,
or set its style (with
.Fl P ) .
If one of
.Fl D ,
.Fl L ,
.Fl R ,
or
.Fl U
is used, respectively the pane below, to the left, to the right, or above the
target pane is used.
.Fl l
is the same as using the
.Ic last-pane
command.
.Fl e
enables or
.Fl d
disables input to the pane.
.Pp
.Fl m
and
.Fl M
are used to set and clear the

There is one marked pane at a time, setting a new marked pane clears the last.
The marked pane is the default target for
.Fl s
to
.Ic join-pane ,
.Ic swap-pane
and
.Ic swap-window .
.Pp
Each pane has a style: by default the
.Ic window-style
and
.Ic window-active-style
options are used,
.Ic select-pane
.Fl P
sets the style for a single pane.
For example, to set the pane 1 background to red:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
select-pane -t:.1 -P 'bg=red'

.Ar target-window .
.Fl l ,
.Fl n
and
.Fl p
are equivalent to the
.Ic last-window ,
.Ic next-window

.Ic previous-window
commands.
If
.Fl T
is given and the selected window is already the current window,
the command behaves like
.Ic last-window .
.It Xo Ic split-window

.Ar target-pane :
.Fl h
does a horizontal split and
.Fl v
a vertical split; if neither is specified,
.Fl v
is assumed.
The
.Fl l
and
.Fl p
options specify the size of the new pane in lines (for vertical split) or in
cells (for horizontal split), or as a percentage, respectively.
The
.Fl b
option causes the new pane to be created to the left of or above
.Ar target-pane .
All other options have the same meaning as for the

.D1 (alias: Ic swapp )
Swap two panes.
If
.Fl U
is used and no source pane is specified with
.Fl s ,
.Ar dst-pane
is swapped with the previous pane (before it numerically);
.Fl D
swaps with the next pane (after it numerically).
.Fl d
instructs
.Nm
not to change the active pane.
.Pp
If
.Fl s
is omitted and a marked pane is present (see
.Ic select-pane
.Fl m ) ,
the marked pane is used rather than the current pane.
.It Xo Ic swap-window
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl s Ar src-window
.Op Fl t Ar dst-window
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic swapw )
This is similar to
.Ic link-window ,
except the source and destination windows are swapped.
It is an error if no window exists at
.Ar src-window .
.Pp
Like
.Ic swap-pane ,
if
.Fl s
is omitted and a marked pane is present (see
.Ic select-pane
.Fl m ) ,
the window containing the marked pane is used rather than the current window.
.It Xo Ic unlink-window
.Op Fl k
.Op Fl t Ar target-window
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic unlinkw )
Unlink
.Ar target-window .
Unless
.Fl k
is given, a window may be unlinked only if it is linked to multiple sessions -
windows may not be linked to no sessions;
if
.Fl k
is specified and the window is linked to only one session, it is unlinked and
destroyed.
.El
.Sh KEY BINDINGS
.Nm
allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a prefix key.
When specifying keys, most represent themselves (for example
.Ql A
to
.Ql Z ) .
Ctrl keys may be prefixed with
.Ql C-
or
.Ql ^ ,
and Alt (meta) with
.Ql M- .
In addition, the following special key names are accepted:
.Em Up ,
.Em Down ,
.Em Left ,
.Em Right ,
.Em BSpace ,
.Em BTab ,
.Em DC
(Delete),
.Em End ,
.Em Enter ,
.Em Escape ,
.Em F1
to
.Em F12 ,
.Em Home ,
.Em IC
(Insert),
.Em NPage/PageDown/PgDn ,
.Em PPage/PageUp/PgUp ,
.Em Space ,
and
.Em Tab .
Note that to bind the
.Ql \&"
or
.Ql '
keys, quotation marks are necessary, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind-key '"' split-window
bind-key "'" new-window
.Ed
.Pp
Commands related to key bindings are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic bind-key
.Op Fl cnr
.Op Fl t Ar mode-table
.Op Fl T Ar key-table
.Ar key Ar command Op Ar arguments
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic bind )
Bind key
.Ar key
to
.Ar command .
Keys are bound in a key table.
By default (without -T), the key is bound in
the
.Em prefix
key table.
This table is used for keys pressed after the prefix key (for example,
by default
.Ql c
is bound to
.Ic new-window
in the
.Em prefix
table, so
.Ql C-b c
creates a new window).
The
.Em root
table is used for keys pressed without the prefix key: binding
.Ql c
to
.Ic new-window
in the
.Em root
table (not recommended) means a plain
.Ql c
will create a new window.
.Fl n
is an alias
for
.Fl T Ar root .
Keys may also be bound in custom key tables and the
.Ic switch-client
.Fl T
command used to switch to them from a key binding.
The
.Fl r
flag indicates this key may repeat, see the
.Ic repeat-time
option.
.Pp
If
.Fl t
is present,
.Ar key
is bound in
.Ar mode-table :
the binding for command mode with
.Fl c
or for normal mode without.
See the
.Sx WINDOWS AND PANES
section and the
.Ic list-keys
command for information on mode key bindings.
.Pp
To view the default bindings and possible commands, see the
.Ic list-keys
command.
.It Xo Ic list-keys
.Op Fl t Ar mode-table
.Op Fl T Ar key-table
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic lsk )
List all key bindings.
Without
.Fl T
all key tables are printed.
With
.Fl T
only
.Ar key-table .
.Pp
With
.Fl t ,
the key bindings in
.Ar mode-table
are listed; this may be one of:
.Em vi-edit ,
.Em emacs-edit ,
.Em vi-choice ,
.Em emacs-choice ,
.Em vi-copy
or
.Em emacs-copy .
.It Xo Ic send-keys
.Op Fl lMR
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Ar key Ar ...
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic send )
Send a key or keys to a window.
Each argument
.Ar key
is the name of the key (such as
.Ql C-a
or
.Ql npage
) to send; if the string is not recognised as a key, it is sent as a series of
characters.
The
.Fl l
flag disables key name lookup and sends the keys literally.
All arguments are sent sequentially from first to last.
The
.Fl R
flag causes the terminal state to be reset.
.Pp
.Fl M
passes through a mouse event (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see
.Sx MOUSE SUPPORT ) .
.It Xo Ic send-prefix
.Op Fl 2
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Xc
Send the prefix key, or with
.Fl 2
the secondary prefix key, to a window as if it was pressed.
.It Xo Ic unbind-key
.Op Fl acn
.Op Fl t Ar mode-table
.Op Fl T Ar key-table
.Ar key
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic unbind )
Unbind the command bound to
.Ar key .
.Fl c ,
.Fl n ,
.Fl T
and
.Fl t
are the same as for
.Ic bind-key .
If
.Fl a
is present, all key bindings are removed.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
The appearance and behaviour of
.Nm
may be modified by changing the value of various options.
There are three types of option:
.Em server options ,
.Em session options
and
.Em window options .
.Pp
The
.Nm
server has a set of global options which do not apply to any particular
window or session.
These are altered with the
.Ic set-option
.Fl s
command, or displayed with the
.Ic show-options
.Fl s
command.
.Pp
In addition, each individual session may have a set of session options, and
there is a separate set of global session options.
Sessions which do not have a particular option configured inherit the value
from the global session options.
Session options are set or unset with the
.Ic set-option
command and may be listed with the
.Ic show-options
command.
The available server and session options are listed under the
.Ic set-option
command.
.Pp
Similarly, a set of window options is attached to each window, and there is
a set of global window options from which any unset options are inherited.
Window options are altered with the
.Ic set-window-option
command and can be listed with the
.Ic show-window-options
command.
All window options are documented with the
.Ic set-window-option
command.
.Pp
.Nm
also supports user options which are prefixed with a
.Ql \&@ .
User options may have any name, so long as they are prefixed with
.Ql \&@ ,
and be set to any string.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ tmux setw -q @foo "abc123"
$ tmux showw -v @foo
abc123
.Ed
.Pp
Commands which set options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic set-option
.Op Fl agoqsuw
.Op Fl t Ar target-session | Ar target-window
.Ar option Ar value
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic set )
Set a window option with
.Fl w
(equivalent to the
.Ic set-window-option
command),
a server option with
.Fl s ,
otherwise a session option.
If
.Fl g
is given, the global session or window option is set.
The
.Fl u
flag unsets an option, so a session inherits the option from the global
options (or with
.Fl g ,
restores a global option to the default).
.Pp
The
.Fl o
flag prevents setting an option that is already set and the
.Fl q
flag suppresses errors about unknown or ambiguous options.
.Pp
With
.Fl a ,
and if the option expects a string or a style,
.Ar value
is appended to the existing setting.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set -g status-left "foo"
set -ag status-left "bar"
.Ed
.Pp
Will result in
.Ql foobar .
And:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set -g status-style "bg=red"
set -ag status-style "fg=blue"
.Ed
.Pp
Will result in a red background
.Em and
blue foreground.
Without
.Fl a ,
the result would be the default background and a blue foreground.
.Pp
Available window options are listed under
.Ic set-window-option .
.Pp
.Ar value
depends on the option and may be a number, a string, or a flag (on, off, or
omitted to toggle).
.Pp
Available server options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic buffer-limit Ar number
Set the number of buffers; as new buffers are added to the top of the stack,
old ones are removed from the bottom if necessary to maintain this maximum
length.
.It Ic default-terminal Ar terminal
Set the default terminal for new windows created in this session - the
default value of the
.Ev TERM
environment variable.
For
.Nm
to work correctly, this
.Em must
be set to
.Ql screen ,
.Ql tmux
or a derivative of them.
.It Ic escape-time Ar time
Set the time in milliseconds for which
.Nm
waits after an escape is input to determine if it is part of a function or meta
key sequences.
The default is 500 milliseconds.
.It Xo Ic exit-unattached
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
If enabled, the server will exit when there are no attached clients.
.It Xo Ic focus-events
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
When enabled, focus events are requested from the terminal if supported and
passed through to applications running in
.Nm .
Attached clients should be detached and attached again after changing this
option.
.It Ic history-file Ar path
If not empty, a file to which
.Nm
will write command prompt history on exit and load it from on start.
.It Ic message-limit Ar number
Set the number of error or information messages to save in the message log for
each client.
The default is 100.
.It Xo Ic set-clipboard
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
Attempt to set the terminal clipboard content using the
\ee]52;...\e007
.Xr xterm 1
escape sequences.
This option is on by default if there is an
.Em \&Ms
entry in the
.Xr terminfo 5
description for the client terminal.
Note that this feature needs to be enabled in
.Xr xterm 1
by setting the resource:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
disallowedWindowOps: 20,21,SetXprop
.Ed
.Pp
Or changing this property from the
.Xr xterm 1
interactive menu when required.
.It Ic terminal-overrides Ar string
Contains a list of entries which override terminal descriptions read using
.Xr terminfo 5 .
.Ar string
is a comma-separated list of items each a colon-separated string made up of a
terminal type pattern (matched using
.Xr fnmatch 3 )
and a set of
.Em name=value
entries.
.Pp
For example, to set the
.Ql clear
.Xr terminfo 5
entry to
.Ql \ee[H\ee[2J
for all terminal types and the
.Ql dch1
entry to
.Ql \ee[P
for the
.Ql rxvt
terminal type, the option could be set to the string:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
"*:clear=\ee[H\ee[2J,rxvt:dch1=\ee[P"
.Ed
.Pp
The terminal entry value is passed through
.Xr strunvis 3
before interpretation.
The default value forcibly corrects the
.Ql colors
entry for terminals which support 256 colours:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
"*256col*:colors=256,xterm*:XT"
.Ed
.El
.Pp
Available session options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic assume-paste-time Ar milliseconds

.Ar milliseconds ,
they are assumed to have been pasted rather than typed and
.Nm
key bindings are not processed.
The default is one millisecond and zero disables.
.It Ic base-index Ar index
Set the base index from which an unused index should be searched when a new
window is created.
The default is zero.
.It Xo Ic bell-action
.Op Ic any | none | current | other
.Xc
Set action on window bell.
.Ic any
means a bell in any window linked to a session causes a bell in the current
window of that session,
.Ic none
means all bells are ignored,
.Ic current
means only bells in windows other than the current window are ignored and
.Ic other
means bells in the current window are ignored but not those in other windows.
.It Xo Ic bell-on-alert
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
If on, ring the terminal bell when an alert
occurs.
.It Ic default-command Ar shell-command
Set the command used for new windows (if not specified when the window is
created) to
.Ar shell-command ,
which may be any
.Xr sh 1
command.
The default is an empty string, which instructs
.Nm
to create a login shell using the value of the
.Ic default-shell
option.
.It Ic default-shell Ar path
Specify the default shell.
This is used as the login shell for new windows when the
.Ic default-command
option is set to empty, and must be the full path of the executable.
When started
.Nm
tries to set a default value from the first suitable of the
.Ev SHELL
environment variable, the shell returned by
.Xr getpwuid 3 ,
or
.Pa /bin/sh .
This option should be configured when
.Nm
is used as a login shell.
.It Xo Ic destroy-unattached
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
If enabled and the session is no longer attached to any clients, it is
destroyed.
.It Xo Ic detach-on-destroy
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
If on (the default), the client is detached when the session it is attached to
is destroyed.
If off, the client is switched to the most recently active of the remaining
sessions.
.It Ic display-panes-active-colour Ar colour
Set the colour used by the
.Ic display-panes
command to show the indicator for the active pane.
.It Ic display-panes-colour Ar colour
Set the colour used by the
.Ic display-panes
command to show the indicators for inactive panes.
.It Ic display-panes-time Ar time
Set the time in milliseconds for which the indicators shown by the
.Ic display-panes
command appear.
.It Ic display-time Ar time
Set the amount of time for which status line messages and other on-screen
indicators are displayed.
.Ar time
is in milliseconds.
.It Ic history-limit Ar lines
Set the maximum number of lines held in window history.
This setting applies only to new windows - existing window histories are not
resized and retain the limit at the point they were created.
.It Ic lock-after-time Ar number
Lock the session (like the
.Ic lock-session
command) after
.Ar number
seconds of inactivity.
The default is not to lock (set to 0).
.It Ic lock-command Ar shell-command
Command to run when locking each client.
The default is to run
.Xr lock 1
with
.Fl np .
.It Ic message-command-style Ar style
Set status line message command style, where
.Ar style
is a comma-separated list of characteristics to be specified.
.Pp
These may be
.Ql bg=colour
to set the background colour,
.Ql fg=colour
to set the foreground colour, and a list of attributes as specified below.
.Pp
The colour is one of:
.Ic black ,
.Ic red ,
.Ic green ,
.Ic yellow ,
.Ic blue ,
.Ic magenta ,
.Ic cyan ,
.Ic white ,
aixterm bright variants (if supported:
.Ic brightred ,
.Ic brightgreen ,
and so on),
.Ic colour0
to
.Ic colour255
from the 256-colour set,
.Ic default ,
or a hexadecimal RGB string such as
.Ql #ffffff ,
which chooses the closest match from the default 256-colour set.
.Pp
The attributes is either
.Ic none
or a comma-delimited list of one or more of:
.Ic bright
(or
.Ic bold ) ,
.Ic dim ,
.Ic underscore ,
.Ic blink ,
.Ic reverse ,
.Ic hidden ,
or
.Ic italics ,
to turn an attribute on, or an attribute prefixed with
.Ql no
to turn one off.
.Pp
Examples are:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
fg=yellow,bold,underscore,blink
bg=black,fg=default,noreverse
.Ed
.Pp
With the
.Fl a
flag to the
.Ic set-option
command the new style is added otherwise the existing style is replaced.
.It Ic message-style Ar style
Set status line message style.
For how to specify
.Ar style ,
see the
.Ic message-command-style

windows in numerical order.
This respects the
.Ic base-index
option if it has been set.
If off, do not renumber the windows.
.It Ic repeat-time Ar time
Allow multiple commands to be entered without pressing the prefix-key again
in the specified
.Ar time
milliseconds (the default is 500).
Whether a key repeats may be set when it is bound using the
.Fl r
flag to
.Ic bind-key .
Repeat is enabled for the default keys bound to the
.Ic resize-pane
command.
.It Xo Ic set-remain-on-exit
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
Set the
.Ic remain-on-exit
window option for any windows first created in this session.
When this option is true, windows in which the running program has

.Ar style ,
see the
.Ic message-command-style
option.
.It Xo Ic status-utf8
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
Instruct
.Nm
to treat top-bit-set characters in the
.Ic status-left
and
.Ic status-right
strings as UTF-8; notably, this is important for wide characters.
This option defaults to off.
.It Ic update-environment Ar variables
Set a space-separated string containing a list of environment variables to be
copied into the session environment when a new session is created or an
existing session is attached.
Any variables that do not exist in the source environment are set to be
removed from the session environment (as if
.Fl r
was given to the
.Ic set-environment
command).
The default is
"DISPLAY SSH_ASKPASS SSH_AUTH_SOCK SSH_AGENT_PID SSH_CONNECTION WINDOWID
XAUTHORITY".
.It Xo Ic visual-activity
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
If on, display a status line message when activity occurs in a window
for which the
.Ic monitor-activity
window option is enabled.
.It Xo Ic visual-bell
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
If this option is on, a message is shown on a bell instead of it being passed
through to the terminal (which normally makes a sound).
Also see the
.Ic bell-action
option.
.It Xo Ic visual-silence
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
If
.Ic monitor-silence
is enabled, prints a message after the interval has expired on a given window.
.It Ic word-separators Ar string
Sets the session's conception of what characters are considered word
separators, for the purposes of the next and previous word commands in
copy mode.
The default is
.Ql \ -_@ .
.El
.It Xo Ic set-window-option
.Op Fl agoqu
.Op Fl t Ar target-window
.Ar option Ar value
.Xc

command.
.Pp
Supported window options are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo Ic aggressive-resize
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
Aggressively resize the chosen window.
This means that
.Nm
will resize the window to the size of the smallest session for which it is the
current window, rather than the smallest session to which it is attached.
The window may resize when the current window is changed on another sessions;
this option is good for full-screen programs which support
.Dv SIGWINCH
and poor for interactive programs such as shells.
.Pp
.It Xo Ic allow-rename
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
Allow programs to change the window name using a terminal escape
sequence (\\033k...\\033\\\\).
The default is on.
.Pp
.It Xo Ic alternate-screen
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
This option configures whether programs running inside
.Nm
may use the terminal alternate screen feature, which allows the
.Em smcup
and
.Em rmcup
.Xr terminfo 5
capabilities.
The alternate screen feature preserves the contents of the window when an
interactive application starts and restores it on exit, so that any output
visible before the application starts reappears unchanged after it exits.
The default is on.
.Pp
.It Xo Ic automatic-rename
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
Control automatic window renaming.
When this setting is enabled,
.Nm
will rename the window automatically using the format specified by
.Ic automatic-rename-format .
This flag is automatically disabled for an individual window when a name
is specified at creation with
.Ic new-window
or
.Ic new-session ,
or later with
.Ic rename-window ,
or with a terminal escape sequence.
It may be switched off globally with:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set-window-option -g automatic-rename off
.Ed
.Pp
.It Ic automatic-rename-format Ar format
The format (see
.Sx FORMATS )
used when the
.Ic automatic-rename
option is enabled.
.Pp
.It Ic clock-mode-colour Ar colour
Set clock colour.
.Pp
.It Xo Ic clock-mode-style
.Op Ic 12 | 24
.Xc
Set clock hour format.
.Pp
.It Ic force-height Ar height
.It Ic force-width Ar width
Prevent
.Nm
from resizing a window to greater than
.Ar width
or
.Ar height .
A value of zero restores the default unlimited setting.
.Pp
.It Ic main-pane-height Ar height
.It Ic main-pane-width Ar width
Set the width or height of the main (left or top) pane in the
.Ic main-horizontal
or
.Ic main-vertical
layouts.
.Pp
.It Xo Ic mode-keys
.Op Ic vi | emacs
.Xc
Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in copy and choice modes.
As with the
.Ic status-keys
option, the default is emacs, unless
.Ev VISUAL
or
.Ev EDITOR
contains
.Ql vi .
.Pp
.It Ic mode-style Ar style
Set window modes style.
For how to specify
.Ar style ,
see the
.Ic message-command-style
option.
.Pp
.It Xo Ic monitor-activity
.Op Ic on | off
.Xc
Monitor for activity in the window.
Windows with activity are highlighted in the status line.
.Pp
.It Xo Ic monitor-silence
.Op Ic interval
.Xc
Monitor for silence (no activity) in the window within
.Ic interval
seconds.
Windows that have been silent for the interval are highlighted in the
status line.

or the global window options if
.Fl g
is used.
.Fl v
shows only the option value, not the name.
.El
.Sh MOUSE SUPPORT
If the
.Ic mouse
option is on (the default is off),
.Nm
allows mouse events to be bound as keys.
The name of each key is made up of a mouse event (such as
.Ql MouseUp1 )
and a location suffix (one of
.Ql Pane
for the contents of a pane,
.Ql Border
for a pane border or
.Ql Status
for the status line).
The following mouse events are available:
.Bl -column "MouseDown1" "MouseDrag1" "WheelDown" -offset indent
.It Li "MouseDown1" Ta "MouseUp1" Ta "MouseDrag1"
.It Li "MouseDown2" Ta "MouseUp2" Ta "MouseDrag2"
.It Li "MouseDown3" Ta "MouseUp3" Ta "MouseDrag3"
.It Li "WheelUp" Ta "WheelDown" Ta ""
.El
.Pp
Each should be suffixed with a location, for example
.Ql MouseDown1Status .
.Pp
The special token
.Ql {mouse}
or
.Ql =
may be used as
.Ar target-window
or
.Ar target-pane
in commands bound to mouse key bindings.
It resolves to the window or pane over which the mouse event took place
(for example, the window in the status line over which button 1 was released for a
.Ql MouseUp1Status
binding, or the pane over which the wheel was scrolled for a
.Ql WheelDownPane
binding).
.Pp
The
.Ic send-keys
.Fl M
flag may be used to forward a mouse event to a pane.
.Pp
The default key bindings allow the mouse to be used to select and resize panes,
to copy text and to change window using the status line.
These take effect if the
.Ic mouse
option is turned on.
.Sh FORMATS
Certain commands accept the
.Fl F
flag with a
.Ar format
argument.
This is a string which controls the output format of the command.
Replacement variables are enclosed in
.Ql #{
and
.Ql } ,
for example
.Ql #{session_name} .
The possible variables are listed in the table below, or the name of a
.Nm
option may be used for an option's value.
Some variables have a shorter alias such as
.Ql #S ,
and
.Ql ##
is replaced by a single
.Ql # .
.Pp
Conditionals are available by prefixing with
.Ql \&?
and separating two alternatives with a comma;
if the specified variable exists and is not zero, the first alternative
is chosen, otherwise the second is used.
For example
.Ql #{?session_attached,attached,not attached}
will include the string
.Ql attached
if the session is attached and the string
.Ql not attached
if it is unattached, or
.Ql #{?automatic-rename,yes,no}
will include
.Ql yes
if
.Ic automatic-rename
is enabled, or
.Ql no
if not.
A limit may be placed on the length of the resultant string by prefixing it
by an
.Ql = ,
a number and a colon, so
.Ql #{=10:pane_title}
will include at most the first 10 characters of the pane title.
.Pp
In addition, the first line of a shell command's output may be inserted using
.Ql #() .
For example,
.Ql #(uptime)
will insert the system's uptime.
When constructing formats,
.Nm
does not wait for
.Ql #()
commands to finish; instead, the previous result from running the same command is used,
or a placeholder if the command has not been run before.
Commands are executed with the
.Nm
global environment set (see the
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
section).

.El
.Sh NAMES AND TITLES
.Nm
distinguishes between names and titles.
Windows and sessions have names, which may be used to specify them in targets
and are displayed in the status line and various lists: the name is the
.Nm
identifier for a window or session.
Only panes have titles.
A pane's title is typically set by the program running inside the pane and
is not modified by
.Nm .
It is the same mechanism used to set for example the
.Xr xterm 1
window title in an
.Xr X 7
window manager.
Windows themselves do not have titles - a window's title is the title of its
active pane.
.Nm
itself may set the title of the terminal in which the client is running, see
the
.Ic set-titles
option.
.Pp
A session's name is set with the
.Ic new-session
and
.Ic rename-session
commands.
A window's name is set with one of:
.Bl -enum -width Ds
.It
A command argument (such as
.Fl n
for
.Ic new-window
or
.Ic new-session ) .
.It
An escape sequence:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ printf '\e033kWINDOW_NAME\e033\e\e'
.Ed
.It
Automatic renaming, which sets the name to the active command in the window's
active pane.
See the
.Ic automatic-rename
option.
.El
.Pp
When a pane is first created, its title is the hostname.
A pane's title can be set via the OSC title setting sequence, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ printf '\e033]2;My Title\e033\e\e'
.Ed
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
When the server is started,
.Nm
copies the environment into the
.Em global environment ;
in addition, each session has a
.Em session environment .
When a window is created, the session and global environments are merged.
If a variable exists in both, the value from the session environment is used.
The result is the initial environment passed to the new process.
.Pp
The
.Ic update-environment
session option may be used to update the session environment from the client
when a new session is created or an old reattached.
.Nm
also initialises the
.Ev TMUX
variable with some internal information to allow commands to be executed
from inside, and the
.Ev TERM
variable with the correct terminal setting of
.Ql screen .
.Pp
Commands to alter and view the environment are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic set-environment
.Op Fl gru
.Op Fl t Ar target-session
.Ar name Op Ar value
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic setenv )
Set or unset an environment variable.
If
.Fl g
is used, the change is made in the global environment; otherwise, it is applied
to the session environment for
.Ar target-session .
The
.Fl u
flag unsets a variable.
.Fl r
indicates the variable is to be removed from the environment before starting a
new process.
.It Xo Ic show-environment
.Op Fl gs
.Op Fl t Ar target-session
.Op Ar variable
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic showenv )
Display the environment for
.Ar target-session
or the global environment with
.Fl g .
If
.Ar variable
is omitted, all variables are shown.
Variables removed from the environment are prefixed with
.Ql - .
If
.Fl s
is used, the output is formatted as a set of Bourne shell commands.
.El
.Sh STATUS LINE
.Nm
includes an optional status line which is displayed in the bottom line of each
terminal.
By default, the status line is enabled (it may be disabled with the
.Ic status
session option) and contains, from left-to-right: the name of the current
session in square brackets; the window list; the title of the active pane
in double quotes; and the time and date.
.Pp
The status line is made of three parts: configurable left and right sections
(which may contain dynamic content such as the time or output from a shell
command, see the
.Ic status-left ,
.Ic status-left-length ,
.Ic status-right ,
and
.Ic status-right-length
options below), and a central window list.
By default, the window list shows the index, name and (if any) flag of the
windows present in the current session in ascending numerical order.
It may be customised with the
.Ar window-status-format
and
.Ar window-status-current-format
options.
The flag is one of the following symbols appended to the window name:
.Bl -column "Symbol" "Meaning" -offset indent
.It Sy "Symbol" Ta Sy "Meaning"
.It Li "*" Ta "Denotes the current window."
.It Li "-" Ta "Marks the last window (previously selected)."
.It Li "#" Ta "Window is monitored and activity has been detected."
.It Li "!" Ta "A bell has occurred in the window."
.It Li "~" Ta "The window has been silent for the monitor-silence interval."
.It Li "M" Ta "The window contains the marked pane."
.It Li "Z" Ta "The window's active pane is zoomed."
.El
.Pp
The # symbol relates to the
.Ic monitor-activity
window option.
The window name is printed in inverted colours if an alert (bell, activity or
silence) is present.
.Pp
The colour and attributes of the status line may be configured, the entire
status line using the
.Ic status-style
session option and individual windows using the
.Ic window-status-style
window option.
.Pp
The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has changed, the
interval may be controlled with the
.Ic status-interval
session option.
.Pp
Commands related to the status line are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic command-prompt
.Op Fl I Ar inputs
.Op Fl p Ar prompts
.Op Fl t Ar target-client
.Op Ar template
.Xc
Open the command prompt in a client.
This may be used from inside
.Nm
to execute commands interactively.
.Pp
If
.Ar template
is specified, it is used as the command.
If present,
.Fl I
is a comma-separated list of the initial text for each prompt.
If
.Fl p
is given,
.Ar prompts
is a comma-separated list of prompts which are displayed in order; otherwise
a single prompt is displayed, constructed from
.Ar template
if it is present, or
.Ql \&:
if not.
.Pp
Both
.Ar inputs
and
.Ar prompts
may contain the special character sequences supported by the
.Ic status-left
option.
.Pp
Before the command is executed, the first occurrence of the string
.Ql %%
and all occurrences of
.Ql %1
are replaced by the response to the first prompt, the second
.Ql %%
and all
.Ql %2
are replaced with the response to the second prompt, and so on for further
prompts.
Up to nine prompt responses may be replaced
.Po
.Ql %1
to
.Ql %9
.Pc .
.It Xo Ic confirm-before
.Op Fl p Ar prompt
.Op Fl t Ar target-client
.Ar command
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic confirm )
Ask for confirmation before executing
.Ar command .
If
.Fl p
is given,
.Ar prompt
is the prompt to display; otherwise a prompt is constructed from
.Ar command .
It may contain the special character sequences supported by the
.Ic status-left
option.
.Pp
This command works only from inside
.Nm .
.It Xo Ic display-message
.Op Fl p
.Op Fl c Ar target-client
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Op Ar message
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic display )
Display a message.
If
.Fl p
is given, the output is printed to stdout, otherwise it is displayed in the
.Ar target-client
status line.
The format of
.Ar message
is described in the
.Sx FORMATS
section; information is taken from
.Ar target-pane
if
.Fl t
is given, otherwise the active pane for the session attached to
.Ar target-client .
.El
.Sh BUFFERS
.Nm
maintains a set of named
.Em paste buffers .
Each buffer may be either explicitly or automatically named.
Explicitly named buffers are named when created with the
.Ic set-buffer
or
.Ic load-buffer
commands, or by renaming an automatically named buffer with
.Ic set-buffer
.Fl n .
Automatically named buffers are given a name such as
.Ql buffer0001 ,
.Ql buffer0002
and so on.
When the
.Ic buffer-limit
option is reached, the oldest automatically named buffer is deleted.
Explicitly named are not subject to
.Ic buffer-limit
and may be deleted with
.Ic delete-buffer
command.
.Pp
Buffers may be added using
.Ic copy-mode
or the
.Ic set-buffer
and
.Ic load-buffer
commands, and pasted into a window using the
.Ic paste-buffer
command.
If a buffer command is used and no buffer is specified, the most
recently added automatically named buffer is assumed.
.Pp
A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window.
By default, up to 2000 lines are kept; this can be altered with the
.Ic history-limit
option (see the
.Ic set-option
command above).
.Pp
The buffer commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ic choose-buffer
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Op Fl t Ar target-window
.Op Ar template
.Xc
Put a window into buffer choice mode, where a buffer may be chosen
interactively from a list.
After a buffer is selected,
.Ql %%
is replaced by the buffer name in
.Ar template
and the result executed as a command.
If
.Ar template
is not given, "paste-buffer -b '%%'" is used.
For the meaning of the
.Fl F
flag, see the
.Sx FORMATS
section.
This command works only if at least one client is attached.
.It Ic clear-history Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.D1 (alias: Ic clearhist )
Remove and free the history for the specified pane.
.It Ic delete-buffer Op Fl b Ar buffer-name
.D1 (alias: Ic deleteb )
Delete the buffer named
.Ar buffer-name ,
or the most recently added automatically named buffer if not specified.
.It Xo Ic list-buffers
.Op Fl F Ar format
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic lsb )
List the global buffers.
For the meaning of the
.Fl F
flag, see the
.Sx FORMATS
section.
.It Xo Ic load-buffer
.Op Fl b Ar buffer-name
.Ar path
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic loadb )
Load the contents of the specified paste buffer from
.Ar path .
.It Xo Ic paste-buffer
.Op Fl dpr
.Op Fl b Ar buffer-name
.Op Fl s Ar separator
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic pasteb )
Insert the contents of a paste buffer into the specified pane.
If not specified, paste into the current one.
With
.Fl d ,
also delete the paste buffer.
When output, any linefeed (LF) characters in the paste buffer are replaced with
a separator, by default carriage return (CR).
A custom separator may be specified using the
.Fl s
flag.
The
.Fl r
flag means to do no replacement (equivalent to a separator of LF).
If
.Fl p
is specified, paste bracket control codes are inserted around the
buffer if the application has requested bracketed paste mode.
.It Xo Ic save-buffer
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl b Ar buffer-name
.Ar path
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic saveb )
Save the contents of the specified paste buffer to
.Ar path .
The
.Fl a
option appends to rather than overwriting the file.
.It Xo Ic set-buffer
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl b Ar buffer-name
.Op Fl n Ar new-buffer-name
.Ar data
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic setb )
Set the contents of the specified buffer to
.Ar data .
The
.Fl a
option appends to rather than overwriting the buffer.
The
.Fl n
option renames the buffer to
.Ar new-buffer-name .
.It Xo Ic show-buffer
.Op Fl b Ar buffer-name
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic showb )
Display the contents of the specified buffer.
.El
.Sh MISCELLANEOUS
Miscellaneous commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic clock-mode Op Fl t Ar target-pane
Display a large clock.
.It Xo Ic if-shell
.Op Fl bF
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Ar shell-command command
.Op Ar command

returns success or the second
.Ar command
otherwise.
Before being executed,
.Ar shell-command
is expanded using the rules specified in the
.Sx FORMATS
section, including those relevant to
.Ar target-pane .
With
.Fl b ,
.Ar shell-command
is run in the background.
.Pp
If
.Fl F
is given,
.Ar shell-command
is not executed but considered success if neither empty nor zero (after formats
are expanded).
.It Ic lock-server
.D1 (alias: Ic lock )
Lock each client individually by running the command specified by the
.Ic lock-command
option.
.It Xo Ic run-shell
.Op Fl b
.Op Fl t Ar target-pane
.Ar shell-command
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic run )
Execute
.Ar shell-command
in the background without creating a window.
Before being executed, shell-command is expanded using the rules specified in
the
.Sx FORMATS
section.
With
.Fl b ,
the command is run in the background.
After it finishes, any output to stdout is displayed in copy mode (in the pane
specified by
.Fl t
or the current pane if omitted).
If the command doesn't return success, the exit status is also displayed.
.It Xo Ic wait-for
.Op Fl L | S | U
.Ar channel
.Xc
.D1 (alias: Ic wait )
When used without options, prevents the client from exiting until woken using
.Ic wait-for
.Fl S
with the same channel.
When
.Fl L
is used, the channel is locked and any clients that try to lock the same
channel are made to wait until the channel is unlocked with
.Ic wait-for
.Fl U .
This command only works from outside
.Nm .
.El
.Sh TERMINFO EXTENSIONS
.Nm
understands some extensions to
.Xr terminfo 5 :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em Cs , Cr
Set the cursor colour.
The first takes a single string argument and is used to set the colour;
the second takes no arguments and restores the default cursor colour.
If set, a sequence such as this may be used
to change the cursor colour from inside
.Nm :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ printf '\e033]12;red\e033\e\e'
.Ed
.It Em \&Ss , Se
Set or reset the cursor style.
If set, a sequence such as this may be used
to change the cursor to an underline:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ printf '\e033[4 q'
.Ed
.Pp
If
.Em Se
is not set, \&Ss with argument 0 will be used to reset the cursor style instead.
.It Em \&Ms
This sequence can be used by
.Nm
to store the current buffer in the host terminal's selection (clipboard).
See the
.Em set-clipboard
option above and the
.Xr xterm 1
man page.
.El
.Sh CONTROL MODE
.Nm
offers a textual interface called
.Em control mode .
This allows applications to communicate with
.Nm
using a simple text-only protocol.
.Pp
In control mode, a client sends
.Nm
commands or command sequences terminated by newlines on standard input.
Each command will produce one block of output on standard output.
An output block consists of a
.Em %begin
line followed by the output (which may be empty).
The output block ends with a
.Em %end
or
.Em %error .
.Em %begin
and matching
.Em %end
or
.Em %error
have two arguments: an integer time (as seconds from epoch) and command number.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
%begin 1363006971 2
0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2 (active)
%end 1363006971 2
.Ed
.Pp
In control mode,
.Nm
outputs notifications.
A notification will never occur inside an output block.
.Pp
The following notifications are defined:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic %exit Op Ar reason
The
.Nm
client is exiting immediately, either because it is not attached to any session
or an error occurred.
If present,
.Ar reason
describes why the client exited.
.It Ic %layout-change Ar window-id Ar window-layout
The layout of a window with ID
.Ar window-id
changed.
The new layout is
.Ar window-layout .
.It Ic %output Ar pane-id Ar value
A window pane produced output.
.Ar value
escapes non-printable characters and backslash as octal \\xxx.
.It Ic %session-changed Ar session-id Ar name
The client is now attached to the session with ID
.Ar session-id ,
which is named
.Ar name .
.It Ic %session-renamed Ar name
The current session was renamed to
.Ar name .
.It Ic %sessions-changed
A session was created or destroyed.
.It Ic %unlinked-window-add Ar window-id
The window with ID
.Ar window-id
was created but is not linked to the current session.
.It Ic %window-add Ar window-id
The window with ID
.Ar window-id
was linked to the current session.
.It Ic %window-close Ar window-id
The window with ID
.Ar window-id
closed.
.It Ic %window-renamed Ar window-id Ar name
The window with ID
.Ar window-id
was renamed to
.Ar name .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "@SYSCONFDIR@/tmux.confXXX" -compact
.It Pa ~/.tmux.conf

.It Pa @SYSCONFDIR@/tmux.conf
System-wide configuration file.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To create a new
.Nm
session running
.Xr vi 1 :
.Pp
.Dl $ tmux new-session vi
.Pp
Most commands have a shorter form, known as an alias.
For new-session, this is
.Ic new :
.Pp
.Dl $ tmux new vi
.Pp
Alternatively, the shortest unambiguous form of a command is accepted.
If there are several options, they are listed:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ tmux n
ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window, next-window
.Ed
.Pp
Within an active session, a new window may be created by typing
.Ql C-b c
(Ctrl
followed by the
.Ql b
key
followed by the
.Ql c
key).
.Pp
Windows may be navigated with:
.Ql C-b 0
(to select window 0),
.Ql C-b 1
(to select window 1), and so on;
.Ql C-b n
to select the next window; and
.Ql C-b p
to select the previous window.
.Pp
A session may be detached using
.Ql C-b d
(or by an external event such as
.Xr ssh 1
disconnection) and reattached with:
.Pp
.Dl $ tmux attach-session
.Pp
Typing
.Ql C-b \&?
lists the current key bindings in the current window; up and down may be used
to navigate the list or
.Ql q
to exit from it.
.Pp
Commands to be run when the
.Nm
server is started may be placed in the
.Pa ~/.tmux.conf
configuration file.
Common examples include:
.Pp
Changing the default prefix key:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set-option -g prefix C-a
unbind-key C-b
bind-key C-a send-prefix
.Ed
.Pp
Turning the status line off, or changing its colour:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set-option -g status off
set-option -g status-style bg=blue
.Ed
.Pp
Setting other options, such as the default command,
or locking after 30 minutes of inactivity:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set-option -g default-command "exec /bin/ksh"
set-option -g lock-after-time 1800
.Ed
.Pp
Creating new key bindings:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind-key b set-option status
bind-key / command-prompt "split-window 'exec man %%'"
bind-key S command-prompt "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"
