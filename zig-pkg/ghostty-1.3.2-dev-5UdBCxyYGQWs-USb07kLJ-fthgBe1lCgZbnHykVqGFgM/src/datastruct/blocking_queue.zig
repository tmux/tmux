/// This is tailor made for ghostty usage so it isn't meant to be maximally
/// generic, but I'm happy to make it more generic over time. Traits of this
/// queue that are specific to our usage:
///
///   - Fixed size. We expect our queue to quickly drain and also not be
///     too large so we prefer a fixed size queue for now.
///   - No blocking pop. We use an external event loop mechanism such as
///     eventfd to notify our waiter that there is no data available so
///     we don't need to implement a blocking pop.
///   - Drain function. Most queues usually pop one at a time. We have
///     a mechanism for draining since on every IO loop our TTY drains
///     the full queue so we can get rid of the overhead of a ton of
///     locks and bounds checking and do a one-time drain.
///
/// One key usage pattern is that our blocking queues are single producer
/// single consumer (SPSC). This should let us do some interesting optimizations
/// in the future. At the time of writing this, the blocking queue implementation
/// is purposely naive to build something quickly, but we should benchmark
/// and make this more optimized as necessary.
