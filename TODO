- key remapping
- decide if TIOCPKT is necessary and either handle it or remove the code
- it would be nice if there wasn't so much copying buffers about, audit uses
- window names
- status bar
- useful env vars like WINDOW
- lots of scripting love: add, remove, move around windows, status bar
- sort out who controls the buffers in local.c a bit
- better checking/emulation for missing term requirements
- alt charset, borders etc (terminfo(5)/Line Graphics)
- use default shell rather than fixed
- wrap windows with forward/back
- new window command prompt
- mouse handling and some other bits elinks needs
