- implicitly add exec to the commands for new windows (switch to disable it)?
- commands:
 	extend list-clients to list clients attached to a session (-a for all?)
	bring back detach-session to detach all clients on a session?
- allow fnmatch for -c, so that you can, eg, detach all clients
- garbage collect window history (100 lines at a time?) if it hasn't been used
  in $x time
- lift SHRT_MAX limits for history?
- flags to centre screen in window
- activity/bell should be per-window not per-link? what if it is cur win in
  session not being watched?
- next prev word etc in command prompt
- use a better termcap internally instead of screen, perhaps xterm
- should be able to move to a hidden pane and it would be moved into view. pane
  number in status line/top-right would be cool for this
- support other mouse modes (highlight etc) and use it in copy mode
- set-remain-on-exit is a bit of a hack, some way to do it generically?
- clear window title on exit
- would be nice to be able to use "--" to mark start of command w/ neww etc
  to avoid quoting
- make command sequences more usable: don't require space after ;, handle
  errors better
- attach should have a flag to create session if it doesn't exist
- choice and more mode would be better per client than per window?
- hooks to which commands may be attached, for example: tmux add-hook
  "new-session" if-shell "[ -e $HOME/.tmux-session.conf ]" source-file
  $HOME/.tmux-session.conf
- get it passing all the vttest tests that don't require resizing the terminal
- way to set socket path from config file
- what about utmp etc? can tmux update it like screen? setgid?
- warts on current naming:
  	- display-time but message-fg/bg/attr
	- list-* vs show-*
	- server-info
	- up-pane/down-pane/swap-pane -U/swap-pane -D vs next-*/previous-*
	- split-window -> split-pane??
- a way for force-width/height to apply to only one pane (how?)
- command to list what is actually running in each window with command line,
  pid (need some adaption of the osdep code)
- support for bce
- some way to force a screen to use the entire terminal even if it is forced
  to be smaller by other clients. pan smaller terminal? (like screen F)
	-- idea of a "view" onto a window, need base x/y offsets for redraw
- handle resize better in copy mode
- way to copy stuff that is off screen due to resize
- commands should be able to succeed or fail and have || or && for command
  lists
- some way to KEEP a command running continually and just use its LAST line of
  output
- UTF-8 to a non-UTF-8 terminal should not be able to balls up
  the terminal - www/ruby-addressable; make regress
- support esc-esc to quit in modes
- fix ctrl+F1-F4 output. to what?
- look into xterm clearing its selection when scrolling etc
- better utf8 support: window names, prompt input, message display
- session history for client and last-session command
- option to change status line colour when current window is in a mode?
- option to move copy mode indicator into status line
- list-buffer/show-buffer should display UTF-8
- selection behaviour closer to vi in vi mode
- live update: server started with -U connects to server, requests sessions and
  windows, receives fds
- command to show a tree of sessions-windows-panes (active marked with *)
- sort out inheriting config from shell on new sessions/windows:
        should pick up default-path/termios/etc from client if possible,
	else leave empty/default
- link panes into multiple windows
- -h option to capture-pane to capture the history as well
- bells should be passed between sessions with visual-bell etc
- use screen-256color when started on 256 colour terminal??
- if-shell/run-shell should block further command execution in the same command
  sequence until its shell exits, to allow them to be used from the config file
- better session sharing: create-socket command to create socket somewhere (-r
  flag for readonly)
- allow buffer to be specified when copying in copy mode
- multiline status line (no?)
- flag for absolute pane size to resize-pane
- sanity check input to socket
- support title stack, both internally and externally

- command to show status line information briefly when it is off
- some way to pad # stuff with spaces, #!2T maybe
- FreeBSD console problems
- a binding to "scroll down and exit at bottom" copy mode
- some way to pass keystrokes in copy mode through to underlying window
- last window update time and # replacement for it for display-message
- find-window across sessions - other ways to make session handling easier?
- ' and " should be parsed the same (eg "\e" vs '\e') in config and command
  prompt?
- command to toggle selection not to move it in copy-mode
- why are alerts per-winlink? try per window?
- audit of escape sequence support vs xterm
- support binding keys to mouse (mouse-select-pane -> mouse-keys or something,
  mouse click == select-pane -t %%, mouse scroll up == copy-mode)
- something for -t "last window in session" so a session can be used as a stack
- synchronous commands - client sends cmd and blocks, neww/splitw saves client
  ptr then when program inside died, sends MSG_SOMETHING with wait status to
  client
- documentation improvements - rlpowell's tutorial - build instructions
- bind commands to key sequences?
- monitor, bell etc should monitor /all/ panes in the window not just one
- a history of commands that can be reversed (reverse member of each command,
  and a buffer) info() when changing to same window
- don't pass UTF-8 through vis for titles
- clearing screen should push lines into history
- add a unique ever-increasing pane id to each pane, export it in $TMUX_PANE
   (as %1, %2 etc) and allow it to be used as a target
- way to add dest for break-pane; maybe some easier way to unbreak-pane
- case insensitive searching
- dynamically generated jobs (eg "date ...") do not work well because
  their entries are never collected, should either store status jobs in
  a different tree or flush all unused persist jobs every update rather
  than just updating them
- pane-index option like base-index
- option to move status line to top
- respawn-pane command
- configurable borders and empty space filler for when panes < window?
- mouse-select-pane will screw up with !MODE_MOUSE_STANDARD (it sets the
  flag on w/o checking the others before calling tty_update_mode)
- multiple keys could be done with tables, ie have prefixes go and instead
	bind -n ^A prefix-table "default"
  where prefix-table sets command lookup table and sets prefix flag, then next
  key is looked up in that table
