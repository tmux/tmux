- line mode/char-at-a-time mode a la telnet?
- handle ioctl/termios stuff on window sockets
- figure out once and for all what is going on with backspace and del
      backspace should be translated per the termios setting.
      del passed through?
- window creation/idle time
- profile/optimise, particularly (i suspect) input.c
- could use bsearch all over the place or get rid of smaller tables (clientmsg)
- better errors when creating new windows/sessions (how?)
- Implicitly add exec to the commands for new windows (switch to disable it)
- it would be nice to have multichar commands so you could have C-b K K for
  kill-window to limit accidental presses
- status-fg/status-bg should be able to set attributes: bold, etc
- refer to windows by name etc (duplicates? fnmatch?)
- commands:
	command to run something without a window at all?
	command to purge window history
 	extend list-clients to list clients attached to a session (-a for all?)
	bring back detach-session to detach all clients on a session?
	clone-session command to link all windows to a new session
- function groups, bind-key ^W { select-window 0; send-key ^W } etc ***
- allow fnmatch for -c, so that you can, eg, detach all clients
- bind non prefix keys
- garbage collect window history (100 lines at a time?) if it hasn't been used
  in $x time (need window creation/use times)
- lift SHRT_MAX limits for history
- audit copy/scroll and other modes for problems with very small windows
- split clients into three RB trees by fd: attached/unattached/dead?
  or tailqs? what would be fastest per-char?
- window splitting?
- c/p is still borken in some ways
- better mode features: search, back word, forward word, etc
- flags to centre screen in window
- better terminal emulation (identify, insert mode, some other bits)
- when resizing, use history
- audit for leftover/unused code
- commands:	save-buffer -b number filename
		load-buffer -b number filename
  	      	copy-buffer -s src-session -t dst-session
			-a src-index -b dst-index
		      	(copy from other session)
- activity/bell should be per-window not per-link? what if it is cur win in
  session not being watched?
- tidy up window modes
- problems with force-width when wrapping line in emacs?
- next prev word etc in command prompt; also ^K
- many more info() displays for various things
- vi half page scroll
- backspace should perhaps wrap backwards over newlines which were not moved
  down by a newline: screen and the OS X terminal does this but xterm and most
  others do not. this might be hard: a flag for each grid line (top bit of size
  maybe)? a single flag is insufficient as can't then tell when to /stop/
  unwrapping
- OPTIONS section in man page with description of new option handling
- update set/setw in man page with -g and -u flags
- more # commands in status-left,right eg #H for hostname. others?
- input.c is too complicated. simplify?
- try change from pass-though model to redraw model (use updated screen
  data). maybe too slow though?
- use a better termcap internally instead of screen, perhaps xterm
- tty.c is a bit ugly
- document xterm-keys
- document server-info
- document window options changes
- document clock-mode
- automatic lock/screensaver after $time inactivity (switch all windows into
  clock mode/blank)
- a key binding to display the status line when it is turned off
- FAQ "Can I have some examples of cool things I can do with tmux?" -- linkw
- clone session command
