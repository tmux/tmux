- it would be nice if there wasn't so much copying buffers about, audit uses
- useful env vars like WINDOW
- sort out who controls the buffers in local.c a bit
- better checking/emulation for missing term requirements
- alt charset, borders etc (terminfo(5)/Line Graphics)
- new window command prompt
- mouse handling and some other bits elinks needs
- scrollback
- server doesn't handle SIGTERM anymore...
- copy/paste
- the whole input/screen/local thing sucks a bit, reorganise/redesign it
- line mode/char-at-a-time mode a la telnet?
- some of the uses of buffers really sucks. buffer_reverse_add/remove,
  and buffer_insert_range/delete_range are abominations. this should be
  rethought
- figure out once and for all what is going on with backspace and del
- window creation/idle time
- attributes could be 8 not 16 bits
- profile/optimise, particularly (i suspect) input.c
- tidy up input.c a bit
- decide about customised status line
- client could pass term/tty fd up to server and then do nothing. what problems 
  would this cause? -- need access to all terminfo data at once... signals?
- cleanup/redesign IPC
	IPC is arse-about-face: too much overhead. 8-byte header for each
	packet... hrm. already scanning output for \e, could add an extra
	byte to it for message
- could use bsearch all over the place or get rid of smaller tables (clientmsg)
- better errors when creating new windows/sessions (how?)
- commands should have to care less about CMD_KEY
- CLIENT_HOLD sucks
- session with CMD_NOSESSION should be an error
- each command should have a print op as well for list keys
- List available commands on ambigous command
- Implicitly add exec to the commands for new windows (switch to disable it)
- nested sessions, ie session as window - moving to it moves into session
  (remembering parent)
- Nested sessions over the network, plug-in another tmux as a window/subsession
- it would be nice to have multichar commands so you could have C-b K K for
  kill-window to limit accidental presses
- status-fg/status-bg should be to set attributes: bold, etc
- show-options command
- detach client and other client commands. note that there can only be a
  "current client" on key presses - these should act like detach-session -
  -a will do all clients, otherwise do nothing unless key in which case do
  current client
- check handling of out-of-bound values in input.c, most should be limited
  rather than ignored
- save/restore (DECSC/DECRC) are ugly. maybe a struct screen_attr and memcpy
- force maximum terminal size (centred?)

-- For 0.1 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- man page
- commands:
	rename sessions
	swap windows
		same as link but swap windows if tgt exists else error
	unlink window (error if window only linked to one session)
		tmux -s <sess> unlink-window -i<tgt idx>
	kill session (not bound by default)
- fix most(1) problems after scrolling
- check for some reqd terminfo caps on startup

-- For 0.2 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- copy and paste
- window splitting
