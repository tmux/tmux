- window creation/idle time
- could use bsearch all over the place or get rid of smaller tables (clientmsg)
- better errors when creating new windows/sessions (how?)
- implicitly add exec to the commands for new windows (switch to disable it)?
- it would be nice to have multichar commands eg C-b K K
- commands:
 	extend list-clients to list clients attached to a session (-a for all?)
	bring back detach-session to detach all clients on a session?
- allow fnmatch for -c, so that you can, eg, detach all clients
- bind non prefix keys
- garbage collect window history (100 lines at a time?) if it hasn't been used
  in $x time (need window creation/use times)
- lift SHRT_MAX limits for history?
- audit copy/scroll and other modes for problems with very small windows
- better mode features: search, back word, forward word, etc
- flags to centre screen in window
- better terminal emulation (identify, insert mode, some other bits)
- audit for leftover/unused code
- activity/bell should be per-window not per-link? what if it is cur win in
  session not being watched?
- tidy up window modes
- next prev word etc in command prompt; also ^K
- many more info() displays for various things
- vi half page scroll
- backspace should perhaps wrap backwards over newlines which were not moved
  down by a newline: screen and the OS X terminal does this but xterm and most
  others do not. this might be hard: a flag for each grid line (top bit of size
  maybe)? a single flag is insufficient as can't then tell when to /stop/
  unwrapping
- input.c is too complicated. simplify?
- use a better termcap internally instead of screen, perhaps xterm
- kill all but current pane
- fix rxvt cursor fg issue (text under cursor can have non-white fg)
- key handling sucks a bit and may need to be reworked
- some people find first window being 0 rather than 1 is awkward on the
  keyboard
- client sx/sy should be in tty, then can let the terminal wrap at edge
  to allow xterm to pick up it should be one line for its c/p
- should be able to move to a hidden pane and it would be moved into view. pane
  number in status line/top-right would be cool for this
- command to run something without a window at all - output to
  window-more. what for? isnt this the same as doing it w/ splitw/neww now?
- would be nice if tmux could be the shell (tmux attach, but hard link to tmux
  binary as "tmuxsh" or wrapper script?) problems with tty dev permissions
- support other mouse modes (highlight etc) and use it in copy mode
- set-remain-on-exit is a bit of a hack, some way to do it generically?
- set-option should be set-session-option and should be overall global options
  for stuff like mode keys?
      also quiet, utf8 and maybe other flags?
  -g is a bit unexpected in conf file
- clear window title on exit
- refer to windows by name etc (duplicates? fnmatch?)
- the output code (tty.c) could do with optimisation depending on term
  capibilities
- would be nice to be able to use "--" to mark start of command w/ neww etc
  to avoid quoting
- goto line and search history in copy/scroll modes
- a command to display the status line briefly when it is turned off
- clone session command
- make command sequences more usable: don't require space after ;, handle
  errors better
- might be nice if attach-session behaved like switch-client inside an
  existing client
- key to switch to copy mode from scroll mode
- attach should have a flag to create session if it doesn't exist
- layout/split stuff:
	  ** NEW layout design:
	     1. finish rewrite manual with tree of layout_cell
	     2. convert automatic layout modes to produce a tree and make
	        them one-off operations
	     3. move any size/position details from window_pane to layout_cell
	     3.5. fix -p/-l on split
	     4. a way to address panes by name ("top-left") and position ("0,0")
	 TO TEST: force-width/height OK, respawn-window, rotate-window OK, break-pane??
	** rename split-window -> split-pane
- fix UTF-8 guesswork on sparc64, improve tty checks
- choice and more mode would be better per client than per window?
- some way to force a screen to use the entire terminal even if it is forced
  to be smaller by other clients. pan smaller terminal? (like screen F)
- close/redirect stderr when popen to child proc for #() in status line
- hooks to which commands may be attached, for example:
  	tmux add-hook "new-session" if-shell "[ -e $HOME/.tmux-session.conf ]" source-file $HOME/.tmux-session.conf
- get it passing all the vttest tests that don't require resizing the terminal
- does tmux require a exmple conf? where does it go?
- there are an awful lot of commands. maybe separate man page for conf
  file/commands -similar to ssh/ssh_config?
- esc seq to set window title should be documented and should set automatic-rename
- *** get rid of PANE_HIDDEN -- initially just check for outside window
- way to set socket path from config file
- the "window with one pane" vs window distinction is weird, eg you can't kill-pane the last pane
- status-active-fg/bg/attr would be nice to highlight active window, as would options to set
  the highlight stuff
- XXX once env stuff is in, default-path and VISUAL/EDITOR should be picked up when session is started
- the copy mode next-word behaviour is emacs style (end of word) rather than vi style (start of word) even in vi keys mode,
- when moving up from a blank line in copy mode it always assumes you were at the end of the line so it can be a bit funny. should remember last non-blank x position and use that
- paste-buffer etc should be able to handle \0, so needs a size member and no more strlen
- is utf8 a valid charset in LANG? also check for "unicode" in TERM
- what about utmp etc? can tmux update it like screen? setgid?
- option to show bells visually
- window-status command to show current window info in status line
- H/M/L commands in copy mode with vi-keys, for jumping to the top/middle/last line on the screen
- if the server is started with IDENTIFY_UTF8 then set the global utf8 option?
- I think there are potential leaks in the prompt code if a new prompt is created without the
  callback for the old being cleared; this might be quite hard to hit, lock-server seems the only
  candidate
- tidy up and prioritise todo list ;-)
