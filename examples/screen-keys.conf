# This configuration file binds many of the common GNU screen key bindings to
# appropriate tmux key bindings. Note that for some key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue and also that this set omits binding some commands available in
# tmux but not in screen.
#
# Note this is only a selection of key bindings and they are in addition to the
# normal tmux key bindings. This is intended as an example not as to be used
# as-is.
