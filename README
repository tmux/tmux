Welcome to tmux!

tmux is a "terminal multiplexer", it enables a number of terminals (or windows)
to be accessed and controlled from a single terminal. tmux is intended to be a
simple, modern, BSD-licensed alternative to programs such as GNU screen.

This release runs on OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux, OS X and Solaris.

tmux depends on libevent 2.x. Download it from:

	http://libevent.org

To build tmux from a release tarball, do:

	$ ./configure && make
	$ sudo make install

By default, tmux will use the utempter library to update utmp(5), if it is
installed. Run configure with --disable-utempter to disable this.

To get and build the latest from version control:

	$ git clone https://github.com/tmux/tmux.git
	$ cd tmux
	$ sh autogen.sh
	$ ./configure && make

For more information see http://git-scm.com. Patches should be sent by email to
the mailing list at tmux-users@googlegroups.com.

For documentation on using tmux, see the tmux.1 manpage. It can be viewed from
the source tree with:

	$ nroff -mdoc tmux.1|less

Some common questions are answered in the FAQ file and a more extensive (but
slightly out of date) guide is available in the OpenBSD FAQ at
http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq7.html#tmux. A rough todo list is in the TODO
file and an example configuration in example_tmux.conf.

A vim(1) syntax file is available at:

   https://github.com/keith/tmux.vim
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keith/tmux.vim/master/syntax/tmux.vim

And a bash(1) completion file at:

   https://github.com/przepompownia/tmux-bash-completion

For debugging, running tmux with -v or -vv will generate server and client log
files in the current directory.

tmux mailing lists are available. For general discussion and bug reports:

	https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tmux-users

And for Git commit emails:

	https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tmux-git

Bug reports, feature suggestions and especially code contributions are most
welcome. Please send by email to:
