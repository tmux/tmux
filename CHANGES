* Record last window and ^L key to switch to it. Largely from Maximilian Gass.
* Reset ignored signals in child after forkpty, makes ^C work.
* Wrap on next/previous. From Maximilian Gass.

19 September 2007

* Don't renumber windows on close.

28 August 2007

* Scrolling region (\e[r) support.

27 August 2007

* Change screen.c to work more logically and hopefully fix heap corruption.

09 July 2007

* Initial import to CVS. Basic functions are working, albeit with a couple of 
  showstopper memory bugs and many missing features. Detaching, reattaching,
  creating new sessions, listing sessions work acceptably for using with shells.
  Simple curses programs (top, systat, tetris) and more complicated ones (mutt,
  emacs) that don't require scrolling regions (ESC[r) mostly work fine
  (including mutt, emacs). No status bar yet and no key remapping or other
  customisation.
