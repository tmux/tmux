* (nicm) Error on ambiguous command.

01 October 2007

* (nicm) Restore window title handling.
* (nicm) Simple uncustomisable status line with window list.

30 September 2007

* (nicm) Window info command for debugging, C-b I.

29 September 2007

* (nicm) Deleting/inserting lines should follow scrolling region. Fix.
* (nicm) Allow creation of detached sessions: "tmux new-session -d".
* (nicm) Permit error messages to be passed back for transient clients like 
  rename. Also make rename -i work.
* (nicm) Pass through bell in any window to current.

28 September 2007

* (nicm) Major rewrite of input parser:
	- Lose the old weirdness in favour of a state machine.
	- Merge in parsing from screen.c.
	- Split key parsing off into a separate file.
  This is step one towards hopefully allowing a status line. It requires
  that we output data as if the terminal had one line less than it really does -
  a serious problem when it comes to things like scrolling. This change 
  consolidates all the range checking and limiting together which should make
  it easier.
* (mxey) Added window remaming, like "tmux rename [-s session] [-i index] name"
    
27 September 2007

* Split "tmux list" into "tmux list-sessions" (ls) and "list-windows" (lsw).
* New command session selection:
	- if name is specified, look for it and use it if it exists, otherwise
	  error
	- if no name specified, try the current session from $TMUX
	- if $TMUX doesn't exist, and there is only one session, use it,
	  otherwise error

26 September 2007

* Add command aliases, so "ls" is an alias for "list".
* Rename some commands and alter syntax to take options after a la CVS. Also
  change some flags. So:

	tmux -s/socket -nabc new

  Becomes:
	
	tmux -S/socket new -sabc

* Major tidy and split of client/server code.

22 September 2007

* Window list command (C-b W). Started by Maximilian Gass, finished by me.

20 September 2007

* Specify meta via environment variable (META).
* Record last window and ^L key to switch to it. Largely from Maximilian Gass.
* Reset ignored signals in child after forkpty, makes ^C work.
* Wrap on next/previous. From Maximilian Gass.

19 September 2007

* Don't renumber windows on close.

28 August 2007

* Scrolling region (\e[r) support.

27 August 2007

* Change screen.c to work more logically and hopefully fix heap corruption.

09 July 2007

* Initial import to CVS. Basic functions are working, albeit with a couple of 
  showstopper memory bugs and many missing features. Detaching, reattaching,
  creating new sessions, listing sessions work acceptably for using with shells.
  Simple curses programs (top, systat, tetris) and more complicated ones (mutt,
  emacs) that don't require scrolling regions (ESC[r) mostly work fine
  (including mutt, emacs). No status bar yet and no key remapping or other
  customisation.
