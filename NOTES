* I'm pretty busy these days and tmux is way down my list of priorities, so
  don't expect a lot of progress soon. Contributions welcome!

XXX This is out of date!

Command prefix is C-b. This can be changed by building with, for example:

	META=\\001 make

Commands: d detach
          c create new window
          n next window
          p previous window
	  l last (next to last selected) window
	  r refresh screen
	  w list current windows
	0-9 select window

There is one default server process per user which puts its socket in
/tmp/tmux-UID. It is created the first time tmux is run and subsequent
invocations will connect to the same server. The server holds multiple
sessions.

Syntax is: tmux [-v] [-s path] command [flags]

The command is either list, new or attach. Create a new session with:

	tmux new

Optionally giving it a name with:

	tmux new -n <session name>

Attach to a previous session with:

	tmux attach -n <session name>

A name must (currently) be specified when attaching. This may change.

List all sessions with:

	tmux list

Or the windows of a single session with:

	tmux list -n <session name>

Sessions are destroyed when no windows remain attached to them.

Another server process can be used by specifying an alternative socket path
with "-s <path>" but it shouldn't normally be required.

You can set the window title (listed in -l), using the \e] escape sequence. For
example:

	$ echo -n \\033]0;My Title\\007

There is currently no method for setting the window name (what will eventually
be shown in the status bar).

You might get message "couldn't find server" after a crash, in this case you
must remove the /tmp/tmux-`id -u` file manually.
