Key bindings:
    d detach

    p previous window
    l last (next to last selected) window
    ? list current key bindings
    0-9 select window

There is one default server process per user which puts its socket in
/tmp/tmux-UID. It is created the first time tmux is run and subsequent
invocations will connect to the same server. The server holds multiple
sessions.

Syntax is: tmux [-v] [-S path] [-s session] command [flags]

    -v Create logfiles, verbosity increases with more -v
    -S Set different server socket path
    -s Specify session name for command, if appropriate.

If a session name is not given, the current session is assumed if a command
is run from inside tmux and the TMUX environment variable is available,
otherwise if only one exists, it is used or if multiple exist, an error is
generated.

Commands:
    (Commands can be shortened, as long as they are unambiguous)

    new-session [-d] [-s session name] [-n window name] [command]
        Create new session. Attaches to new session unless -d is given. The
	window name and command are the same as for new-window below.

    attach-session [-d]
        Attach to session. Detaches other clients if -d is given.

    list-sessions
        List sessions (can be shortened to ls).

    list-windows
        List windows (can be shortened to lsw).

    new-window [-d] [-n window name] [command]
	Create a new window. If -d is given, the window is created in the
	background (it doesn't become the current window). The window name
	and the command to run in the window may also be specified.

    rename-window [-i window index] new name
        Rename window.

    bind-key key command
	Bind a key to a command (use ^A for ctrl-A), commands are as listed
        above.

    list-keys
	List current key bindings.

    unbind-key key
	Unbind a key from a command.

    set-option prefix key

Sessions are destroyed when no windows remain attached to them.

There is currently no command to change status bar colour, it can be altered
by adjusting the last argument of line 38 in status.c:

	input_store_two(b, CODE_ATTRIBUTES, ATTR_REVERSE, 0x20);

0x47 is white-on-blue.
